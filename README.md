day1 of node.js
installation and setup with npm. npm is node package manager which includes package files like express.js and manymore
npm is like a store where we can find dependancies and express.js which is framework.
for node.js port 3000 is used, we can also use other ports above 1000. ports 0- 1000 is used by system.

npm init -y -> initializes a new project and creates a package.json file in the current directory.
node app.js -> runs the project in localhost:3000 
node --watch app.js -> restart the project with any changes without having to retype unlike node app.js
